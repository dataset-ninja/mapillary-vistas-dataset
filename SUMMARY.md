**The Mapillary Vistas Dataset for Semantic Understanding of Street Scenes v2.0** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 25000 images with 1872892 labeled objects belonging to 124 different classes including *sky*, *road*, *pole*, and other: *vegetation*, *car*, *building*, *static*, *street light*, *traffic sign (front)*, *curb*, *sidewalk*, *lane marking - straight line*, *lane marking - dashed line*, *fence*, *traffic sign (back)*, *signage - advertisement*, *traffic sign - direction (front)*, *utility pole*, *person*, *terrain*, *wall*, *curb cut*, *traffic light - general (upright)*, *vehicle group*, *signage - store*, *ground*, *dynamic*, *traffic light - pedestrians*, and 96 more.

Images in the Mapillary Vistas dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 5000 (20% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *training* (18000 images), *testing* (5000 images), and *validation* (2000 images). Additionally, every object could be categorized into 8 root-level classes: ***animal***, ***construction***, ***human***, ***marking***, ***marking-only***, ***nature***, ***object***, and ***void***, or into 15 macro-level classes: ***arrow***, ***barrier***, ***continuous***, ***discrete***, ***flat***, ***hatched***, ***person***, ***rider***, ***sign***, ***structure***, ***support***, ***symbol***, ***traffic-light***, ***traffic-sign***, and ***vehicle***. Explore them in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Mapillary, Sweden.
